# ZF Boilerplate #

I know there is already an implementation named "ZF Boilerplate" which is very cool including Doctrine, PHPUnit and other necessary components packed in a single package. However, I often need a very lightweight zf boilerplate to start off quickly with the bare bone components. I don't need doctrine or all those fancy stuff. So I created this package, for personal use. Sharing it on Github in case it might help others. 

I value your feedback. Please feel free to fork and improve the project or contact me for any queries, suggestions or with any criticism.
